# Frontend service 2022

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

To run the app we'll use `pnpm` as our package manager. So if you don't have it already installed in your sysyem you can install it using

> For linux users
```sh
sudo npm i -g pnpm
```

> For windows users 
```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

Once the package manager is installed you can install all the dependancies using...

```sh
pnpm i
```
 or 
 ```sh
 pnpm install
 ```

Once all modules are installed you can launch the dev server using

```sh
pnpm dev
```

For build

```sh
pnpm run build
```
